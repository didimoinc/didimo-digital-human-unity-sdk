# Didimo Asset Fitter

The [Didimo](https://www.didimo.co/) Asset Fitter (Beta) package is a tool used to fit the apparel (clothing, accessories and hairstyle) of a 3rd Party avatar into a didimo. You choose the character with the accessories and any didimo of your choice, and transfer all the attire with the click of a button.

All you need to get up and running after install is included in this README.

The Asset Fitter is located in the Didimo Manager: Window -> Didimo Manager -> Asset Fitter.
