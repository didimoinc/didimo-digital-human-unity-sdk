## Omniverse Audio2Face Integration

Integration with Nvidia's Omniverse Audio2Face. Quickly and easily generate expressive facial animation from just an audio source with NVIDIAâ€™s Deep Learning AI technology. 

To use an animation generated in Audio2Face, find the Animation Controller gameobject, on the scene's Hierarchy, and drag the Weights file and the audio clip into the Inspector and enter Play Mode. The didimo in the scene will playback the animation. 

If you want guidance on how to generate Audio2Face animations for a didimo, please visit our integration tutorial in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.didimo.co/docs/integration-omniverse-audio2face).
