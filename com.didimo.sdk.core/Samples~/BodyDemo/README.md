# Core Examples

Welcome to the Core Examples folder. Following from the [Didimo](https://www.didimo.co/) Unity SDK main README file,
this README will give insight and exhibit the examples present in this folder. The goal is to provide a way to
demonstrate the interactions with the digital humans and their inherent functionalities. More information in
the [Developer Portal](https://developer.didimo.co/docs).

## BodyDemo

Example of how to use Unity's Generic and Humanoid avatars to have body animation on your didimos, with one sample scene for each.
The scenes use Unity's Nav Mesh components to automatically control didimo NPCs, and a didimo you can control with the WASD keys.
