# Core Examples

Welcome to the Core Examples folder. Following from the [Didimo](https://www.didimo.co/) Unity SDK main README file,
this README will give insight and exhibit the examples present in this folder. The goal is to provide a way to
demonstrate the interactions with the digital humans and their inherent functionalities. More information in
the [Developer Portal](https://developer.didimo.co/docs).

## IdleAnimation

This Example folder is used to give the user means of experiencing the Didimo Animation system using a didimo hooked up
with the various animation components, to demonstrate how the idle animations interact with other expressions by playing
them sequentially. More on facial expression on our Developer Portal
page [Facial Animations](https://developer.didimo.co/docs/facial-animations).

* Mocap Idle Animations: We provide 3 different animations for idling, each producing mostly head and eye movements, ideal to
  integrate with speech functionalities.

* Expressions: Six different expressions for emotions are provided.
