This package contains a didimo.

Inside you will find the core avatar file:

"avatar.gltf": your didimo in industry-standard glTF format.

Along with the following binary files:
"mesh_m_low_baseFace_001.bin": geometry, skin, and blendshape data for mesh mesh_m_low_baseFace_001
"mesh_m_low_mouth_001.bin": geometry, skin, and blendshape data for mesh mesh_m_low_mouth_001
"mesh_l_low_eye_001.bin": geometry, skin, and blendshape data for mesh mesh_l_low_eye_001
"mesh_r_low_eye_001.bin": geometry, skin, and blendshape data for mesh mesh_r_low_eye_001
"mesh_m_low_eyeLashes_001.bin": geometry, skin, and blendshape data for mesh mesh_m_low_eyeLashes_001
"animations.bin": animation data

And texture files:
"baseFace_BaseColor_pub_1001.png": diffuse color texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_Normal_pub_1001.png": normal map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_MicroNormal_pub_1001.png": micro normal map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_AO_pub_1001.png": ambient occlusion map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_Spec_pub_1001.png": specular map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_Rough_pub_1001.png": roughness map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_Trans_pub_1001.png": translucency map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_zBiasMask_pub_1001.png": z bias map to prevent the eyelids to clip through the cornea
"baseFace_Cavity_pub_1001.png": cavity map texture covering the head and face
"baseFace_SSS_AO_Mask_pub_1001.png": determines by how much the subsurface scattering contribution is modulated with the ambient occlusion map
"cornea_BaseColor_pub_1001.png": diffuse color texture for the eyes
"cornea_Normal_pub_1001.png": normal map texture for the eyes
"eyeLash_Opacity_pub_1001.png": transparency mask for the eyelashes
"mouthTongue_BaseColor_pub_1001.png": diffuse color texture for the tongue, teeth, upper and lower gums
"mouthTongue_Normal_pub_1001.png": normal map texture for the tongue, teeth, upper and lower gums

Extras:
"deformation_matrix.dmx": to be used on deformation related endpoints


Instructions for the use of your didimo:
----------------------------------------

The provided glTF file includes the mesh geometry of the didimo, an attached facial skeleton, blendshapes, and keyframes for animation and posing.

To use your didimo inside a project or application, import the glTF file using an appropriate glTF importer.

Sometimes the textures may have to be assigned manually, according to the application.

Enjoy your didimo!
