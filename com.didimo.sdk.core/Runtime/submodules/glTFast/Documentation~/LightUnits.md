# Physical Light Units in glTF

Material emission and light intensities in glTF have physical units.

| Light type        | Unit                                  | 
|-------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| Point/Spot        | [Candela (lumen per steradian)][cd]   |
| Directional       | [Lux (lumen per square meter)][lx]    |
| Emissive Material | [Nit (candela per square meter)][nit] |

But these units are only a part of the equation, since the perceived brightness of a light depends on the sensitivity of the viewer. In case of a physical camera, the sensitivity is controlled by its aperture, exposure time and film sensititity (ISO). For example, a candle might light up an entire dark room, but is barely noticable on a bright, sunny day. That's because the camera settings are adjusted to the overall brightness of the scene. This is called exosure control.

Unfortunately exposure control is not yet specified in glTF. Also, many render pipelines (e.g. Universal and Built-in Render Pipeline) do not integrate this concept. They can be thought of having a fixed exposure with a high sensitivity, so that a light with low, single-digit intensity value is enough to bring a scene to full illumination. The implication is that in those exposure-unaware render pipelines correct, physical light units have to be scaled down in order not to overexpose the scene.

An additional problem is, hardly any glTF viewer that lacks exposure control adjust glTF light values, so in practice many glTF creators are forced to use very low, physically implausible light intensity values within glTF assets to compensate the lack of exposure. The High Definition Render Pipeline supports exposure control and accepts values in glTF units in a physically correct manner. In this case the light intensity values have to get amplified to get a realistic result.

## Light Intensity

### Adjusting Values

*glTFast* lets you multiply light intensities by an arbitrary factor (which defaults to 1.0) to make them fit your scene's lighting.

### Reference Values

Here are some light intensity reference values. You may also consult the High Definition Render Pipeline's documentation about [Physical light units][hdrp-plu].

#### Illuminance of Directional Lights

| Full moon on a clear night                     | 0.05–0.3          |
| Dark limit of civil twilight under a clear sky | 3.4               |
| Public areas with dark surroundings            | 20–50             |
